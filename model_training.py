# --> maybe look for it on sklearn ?
# --> check how to train models from images
# If we compare to predictive models we know, I think that :
#   - y value (target) is the class id 
#   - x (features) should contain the images, the parent classes and the morphological features
# From what I understood, the ontology should only contain training values

# TODO Evaluate the model  
# if sklearn or equivalent : score function 
# Otherwise : predict the result for all of the test values and compute manually the different rates

# TODO Trace an RoC curve
